💌 Asking Out on a Date - Just for Fun 😄
Welcome to my spontaneous project! I was a little bored one day and thought, “Why not build a cute little webpage to ask someone out on a date?” So, here it is — a playful and light-hearted web page made just for fun using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

💡 What is this?
This is a simple and interactive webpage where you can "ask someone out" in a fun and slightly cheeky way. It might include buttons, animations, playful prompts — who knows! The goal was just to create something light, creative, and a little different from the usual.
